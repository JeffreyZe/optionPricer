# OptionPricer

A simple yet extendable C++ option pricing library, starting with the Black–Scholes model.  

## 🚀 Features
- European call/put pricing via closed-form Black–Scholes formula
- Calculation of Greeks: Delta, Gamma, Vega, Theta, Rho
- Configurable parameters: spot price, strike, maturity, interest rate, volatility
- Modular design (`Option`, `BlackScholesPricer`, `Utils`) for easy extension
- Unit tests powered by GoogleTest

## 🧭 Roadmap
- Monte Carlo simulation pricer
- PDE solver for option pricing
- Support for exotic options (Barrier, Asian, American approximation)
- Performance optimizations
- Documentation improvements
- And so on ..
